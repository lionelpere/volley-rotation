# PRD: amelioration-representation-terrain

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines comprehensive improvements to the volleyball court representation system, transforming the current basic 9x9 grid into a professional-grade, interactive volleyball court visualization that strictly adheres to official FIVB court dimensions and regulations. The enhancement will provide a precise half-court representation (9m x 9m) with accurate positioning zones, libero placement near the 3-meter attack line, and correct spatial relationships for all six player positions.

The system will deliver superior visual fidelity, enhanced user interactions, accessibility features, and educational overlays while maintaining strict compliance with international volleyball standards for court dimensions, player positioning rules, and libero regulations.

**Value Proposition:** Deliver a world-class, regulation-compliant volleyball court visualization that serves as both an authoritative coaching tool and an effective educational platform, setting new standards for sports application interfaces through precise adherence to FIVB specifications.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations

**Visual Quality Issues:**
- Static court representation lacks professional appeal
- Limited visual feedback during user interactions
- Inconsistent scaling across different devices and screen sizes
- Basic color scheme without accessibility considerations for colorblind users

**User Experience Gaps:**
- Imprecise touch/click interactions, especially on mobile devices
- No visual validation indicators for legal vs illegal player positions
- Missing educational guidance for volleyball rule enforcement
- Lack of contextual information about court zones and their purposes

**Technical Constraints:**
- Performance bottlenecks with complex court rendering
- Limited responsiveness across device form factors
- No animation capabilities for smooth transitions
- Inefficient CustomPainter implementation affecting battery life

### Why This Matters Now

The volleyball rotation tracker has demonstrated strong technical architecture and user adoption potential. However, the court representation—being the primary interface element—currently limits the application's professional appeal and educational effectiveness. Enhanced visualization will:

1. **Increase User Adoption:** Professional-quality graphics attract serious coaches and educational institutions
2. **Improve Learning Outcomes:** Visual guidance accelerates volleyball concept comprehension
3. **Expand Market Reach:** Accessibility features enable broader user base inclusion
