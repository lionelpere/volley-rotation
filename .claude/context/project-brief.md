# Project Brief

## Project Identity

**Project Name:** Volleyball Rotation Tracker  
**Repository:** https://github.com/lionelpere/volley-rotation  
**Project Type:** Flutter Cross-Platform Application  
**Domain:** Sports Technology / Volleyball Coaching Tools  
**Development Approach:** AI-Powered Development (100% Claude AI Generated)

## Project Mission

To provide volleyball coaches, players, and enthusiasts with an intuitive, accurate, and comprehensive tool for managing team rotations, understanding volleyball positioning, and improving strategic gameplay through visual court representation and automated rotation tracking.

## What This Project Does

### Core Purpose
The Volleyball Rotation Tracker is a digital volleyball court simulator that enables users to:
- Visualize player positions on a realistic 9x9 volleyball court
- Track and manage complete 6-player + libero rotation systems
- Generate and navigate all 36 possible rotation combinations
- Manage dual teams (home and visitor) simultaneously
- Maintain data persistence across sessions for continuous use

### Primary Functions

#### 1. Visual Court Management
- Interactive 9x9 volleyball court with professional dimensions
- First-third attack lines clearly marked with dotted extensions
- Real-time player position visualization with customizable jersey numbers
- Click-to-edit functionality for immediate updates

#### 2. Rotation Intelligence
- Complete implementation of official volleyball rotation rules
- Automatic calculation of all possible team rotations
- Libero substitution tracking with back-row rule enforcement
- Rotation validation to prevent illegal formations

#### 3. Team Management
- Dual team support for complete game scenarios
- Player jersey number customization and tracking
- Team configuration saving and loading
- Formation analysis and strategic planning support

#### 4. Educational Support
- Visual learning tool for volleyball rotation concepts
- Rule enforcement to teach proper positioning
- Interactive exploration of rotation possibilities
- Clear demonstration of libero substitution rules

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Volleyball rotation management is complex, error-prone, and often poorly understood:
- **Manual Tracking Errors:** Coaches struggle with manual rotation tracking during fast-paced games
- **Educational Gaps:** Players often don't understand rotation rules and positioning requirements
- **Tool Limitations:** Existing tools are either too simple (6x6 grids) or too complex (enterprise systems)
- **Accessibility Issues:** Professional coaching tools are expensive and platform-specific

### Solution Approach
This project addresses these challenges through:
- **Precision Visualization:** 9x9 court representation for professional-level accuracy
- **Rule Automation:** Built-in volleyball rules prevent errors and teach proper play
- **Universal Access:** Cross-platform availability with offline functionality
- **Educational Focus:** Designed for learning as well as practical game use

### Innovation Aspects
- **AI Development:** 100% AI-generated codebase demonstrating modern development approaches
- **Clean Architecture:** Professional-grade software architecture for maintainability
- **Zero Dependencies:** Fully self-contained application requiring no external services
- **Educational Emphasis:** Teaching tool as well as practical coaching instrument
