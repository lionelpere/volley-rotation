## Performance Considerations

### Flutter Performance Features
```dart
// Built-in optimizations
Widget recycling                # Automatic widget reuse
Tree shaking                    # Dead code elimination
Ahead-of-time compilation       # Optimized release builds
```

### Custom Optimizations
```dart
// Implemented patterns
Immutable state objects         # Reduced rebuilds
Provider.of listen: false       # One-time data access
Selective widget rebuilds       # Precise Consumer usage
Efficient CustomPainter         # Optimized court rendering
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Security
```yaml
# No external API dependencies
# - Zero network requests
# - No authentication required
# - All data stored locally
# - No sensitive information handling

# Local Storage Security
# - SharedPreferences encryption (platform-specific)
# - No credentials or tokens stored
# - User data remains on device
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Development Tools
```yaml
Flutter Inspector              # UI debugging and analysis
Dart DevTools                  # Performance profiling
Flutter logs                   # Runtime debugging
Hot reload/restart             # Rapid development iteration
```

### Error Handling
```dart
// Implemented patterns
try-catch blocks               # Exception handling
Null safety                    # Compile-time null protection
Validation methods             # Input sanitization
Graceful error states          # User-friendly error UI
```

This technology stack represents a modern, cross-platform Flutter application with minimal external dependencies, focusing on performance, maintainability, and AI-assisted development workflows.
