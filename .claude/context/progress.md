## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Code Organization Cleanup
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Action:** Consolidate duplicate volleyball implementations
- **Files:** `volleyball_simplified_flutter/` vs main `lib/` implementation
- **Estimate:** 1-2 hours

### 2. Legacy Code Removal
- **Priority:** Medium  
- **Action:** Remove or integrate legacy state management
- **Files:** `team_state.dart`, `rotation_model.dart`
- **Estimate:** 1 hour

### 3. Context System Completion
- **Priority:** High
- **Action:** Complete `.claude/context/` documentation
- **Status:** In Progress
- **Estimate:** 30 minutes

## Development Metrics

**Codebase Size:**
- Main source: ~2,500+ lines in `lib/`
- Test coverage: Comprehensive business logic testing
- Platform support: 6 platforms (Web, iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, Linux)

**Dependencies:**
- Production: 5 packages (minimal, focused)
- Development: 2 packages (testing + linting)
- Zero external API dependencies (fully self-contained)

**AI Development Stats:**
- 100% AI-generated codebase (Claude Sonnet 4)
- Real-time human-AI collaboration
- Advanced architectural patterns implemented by AI
- Professional-grade volleyball domain modeling

## Quality Indicators

**Code Quality:** Excellent
- Flutter lints enabled and passing
- Comprehensive error handling
- Immutable state patterns
- Clear separation of concerns

**Test Coverage:** High
- All business logic unit tested
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for data flow

**Documentation:** Very Good
- Inline code documentation
- Architecture decision records
- Development workflow guides
- User-facing README

## Blockers & Risks

**Current Blockers:** None

**Technical Debt:**
- Legacy state management files could be removed
- Duplicate volleyball implementations need consolidation
- Some platform-specific configurations could be streamlined

**Dependencies Risk:** Low
- Minimal external dependencies
- All dependencies are stable, well-maintained packages
- No deprecated packages in use
